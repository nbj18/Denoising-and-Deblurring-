In this zip file, we have attached a python file of our code,a excel file of observation and a document file of our report.

In order to run the code, we first have to install the following modules: math, csv and matplotlib using pip 
install in the terminal of your pycharm/spider.

In order to not get any error in the code we have to save the data.csv file, given in the question in the
same folder as the code.

Then we have to open folder in a compiler and run it in your pycharm/spider.
